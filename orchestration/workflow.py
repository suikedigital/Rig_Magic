# The `workflow.py` file in your orchestration directory should contain high-level, multi-step processes that coordinate multiple microservices to accomplish complex tasks. These are not low-level CRUD operations, but rather business logic that spans several services and models.

### Typical Contents of `workflow.py`:

#### 1. **Yacht Creation Workflow**
# - Create a user yacht instance from a base yacht template.
# - Initialize all related microservices (hull, rig, sails, ropes, settings, etc.) for the new yacht.
# - Set up default or user-specified overrides.

#### 2. **Yacht Profile Aggregation**
# - Gather and assemble a complete yacht profile by querying each microservice for the given `yacht_id`.
# - Return a unified data structure for display, export, or analytics.

#### 3. **Update/Clone Workflows**
# - Clone an existing user yacht (deep copy across all microservices).
# - Apply batch updates to a yacht (e.g., update settings and propagate changes to dependent services).

#### 4. **Deletion/Archival**
# - Delete or archive a yacht and all its associated data across microservices.

#### 5. **Analytics/Reporting Triggers**
# - Run analytics or reporting jobs that require orchestrating data from multiple services.

### Example (Pseudocode)


def create_user_yacht_from_base(base_yacht_id, user_id, overrides=None):
    # 1. Instantiate user yacht from base template
    # 2. Initialize hull, rig, sails, ropes, settings, etc.
    # 3. Apply any overrides
    # 4. Return new yacht_id
    pass
    
def get_full_yacht_profile(yacht_id):
    # 1. Query each microservice for yacht_id
    # 2. Assemble and return a complete profile dictionary
    pass

def delete_yacht(yacht_id):
    # 1. Delete yacht from user_yachts
    # 2. Delete all related data in hull, rig, sails, etc.
    pass

# **In summary:**  
# `workflow.py` is where you put orchestration logic that coordinates multiple microservices to implement real-world business processes and user actions.
