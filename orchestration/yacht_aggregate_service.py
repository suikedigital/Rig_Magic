# The `yacht_aggregate_service.py` (sometimes called `YachtAggregateService`) is the orchestration layer responsible for aggregating and coordinating data from all the yacht-related microservices. Its main purpose is to provide high-level operations that require data from multiple domains (hull, rig, sails, ropes, settings, etc.) and present a unified interface for working with a complete yacht.

# ---

## Typical Responsibilities of `yacht_aggregate_service.py`

# 1. **Aggregate Full Yacht Profile**
#    - Collects and assembles all data for a given `yacht_id` from each microservice (hull, rig, sails, ropes, settings, etc.).
#    - Returns a comprehensive yacht profile as a single dictionary or object.

# 2. **Create User Yacht from Base Template**
#    - Handles the instantiation of a new user yacht from a base yacht template.
#    - Initializes all required microservices with the correct data.

# 3. **Update/Clone/Delete Yacht**
#    - Coordinates updates, cloning, or deletion of a yacht across all microservices.

# 4. **Validation and Consistency**
#    - Ensures that all required components exist and are consistent for a given yacht.

# 5. **High-Level Business Logic**
#    - Any workflow that spans multiple microservices but is not specific to a single domain.

## Example: What Would Be in `yacht_aggregate_service.py`


class YachtAggregateService:
    def __init__(self, hull_service, rig_service, sail_service, rope_service, settings_service):
        self.hull_service = hull_service
        self.rig_service = rig_service
        self.sail_service = sail_service
        self.rope_service = rope_service
        self.settings_service = settings_service

    def get_full_yacht_profile(self, yacht_id):
        hull = self.hull_service.get_hull(yacht_id)
        rig = self.rig_service.get_rig(yacht_id)
        sails = self.sail_service.get_sails(yacht_id)
        ropes = self.rope_service.get_ropes(yacht_id)
        settings = self.settings_service.get_settings(yacht_id)
        return {
            "hull": hull.to_dict(),
            "rig": rig.to_dict(),
            "sails": [s.to_dict() for s in sails],
            "ropes": [r.to_dict() for r in ropes],
            "settings": settings.to_dict()
        }

    def create_user_yacht_from_base(self, base_yacht_id, user_id, overrides=None):
        # 1. Copy base yacht template to user_yachts
        # 2. Initialize all microservices for the new yacht_id
        # 3. Apply overrides if provided
        # 4. Return new yacht_id
        pass

    def delete_yacht(self, yacht_id):
        # Delete yacht and all associated data across microservices
        pass


# ---

# **In summary:**  
# `yacht_aggregate_service.py` is the central place for high-level yacht operations that require coordination across multiple microservices, making it easier to manage, retrieve, and manipulate complete yacht data in a modular system.
