# models/ropes/models/ropes/sheets_and_guys

This directory contains rope type classes for sheets and guys used in the running rigging system.

- `sheets/`: Sheet rope classes (e.g., mainsheet, genoa sheet, jib sheet, etc.)
- `guys/`: Guy rope classes (e.g., spinnaker guy, etc.)

Each class implements logic for length, load, and diameter calculation specific to its rope type.
