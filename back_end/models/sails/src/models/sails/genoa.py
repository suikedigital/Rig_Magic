--------
This module defines the Genoa class, representing a genoa foresail for a yacht.

Classes:
    Genoa(BaseSail):
        Represents a genoa foresail, with geometric properties and area calculation.

Typical Usage Example:
    genoa = Genoa(saildata, overlap_percent=120)
    area = genoa.area
    force = genoa.aerodynamic_force(wind_speed_knots=12)

Class Details:
    - The luff and foot are taken from saildata (genoa_i and genoa_j) if not provided.
    - The leech is estimated as the hypotenuse of luff and foot if not provided.
    - Area is calculated as 0.5 * luff * foot (foot includes overlap).
    - Inherits aerodynamic_force() from BaseSail for force estimation.

class Genoa(BaseSail):
    """
    Represents a genoa foresail.

    Args:
        saildata: Data source with geometric properties (genoa_i, genoa_j).
        luff (float, optional): Luff length in meters. Defaults to sqrt(genoa_i^2 + genoa_j^2).
        leech (float, optional): Leech length in meters. Estimated if not provided.
        foot (float, optional): Foot length in meters. Defaults to genoa_j * (overlap_percent / 100).
        overlap_percent (float, optional): Overlap percentage. Defaults to 100.
        yacht_id: Optional identifier for the yacht. Passed to the BaseSail constructor.

    Attributes:
        luff (float): Length of the luff (meters).
        leech (float): Length of the leech (meters).
        foot (float): Length of the foot (meters).
        overlap_percent (float): Overlap percentage used in foot calculation.
        name (str): Name of the sail class ("Genoa").

    Methods:
        area (property): Returns the area of the sail in square meters.
        aerodynamic_force(wind_speed_knots, lift_coefficient=1.0, air_density=1.225):
            Returns the aerodynamic force (Newtons) on the sail for a given wind speed and coefficients.
